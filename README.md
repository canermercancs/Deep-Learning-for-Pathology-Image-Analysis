# PathoImage
Framework for Pathology Image Operations with Deep Learning.

### digiPath module includes whole slide image processing operations. (DONE)
-- please see PLAYGROUND_IMAGES.ipynb and Patch_Sampling.ipynb notebooks to see a selection of operations.

### deepnets module includes the functionality of finetuning previously trained convnets on breast histopathology images. Alexnet and VGG are supported. (ONGOING)
Supported operations include: <br>
-- training convnets from scratch on breast histopathology images. <br>
-- finetuning on patches of consensus ROIs of expert pathologists in histopathology images with 2, 4 or 14 class diagnostic labels associated by the pathologists. <br>
-- extracting convolutional feature representations of small patches of pathology images from a finetuned convnet. <br/>
<br>

Work in progress.
